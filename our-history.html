During the pilot, a female Agent realized none of the existing programs were designed for young women. She created the first Geek Squad Summer Academy camp for girls in Chicago to address this need.</p><p>Seeing the excitement from our newly dubbed "Junior Agents," we realized the potential to do more. We expanded the Academy to new cities, now including young men and women ages 10-18. Through partnerships with nonprofits and youth organizations, GSA has brought tech camps to over 100 cities and military bases, impacting tens of thousands of Junior Agents in the U.S. and <a href="https://bestbuy.ca/geeksquadacademy">Canada</a>.</p><p>Today, our program continues to grow. We now offer year-round curriculum covering robotics, music production, programming, web design, and more - well beyond our original computer repair camps.</p><p>With our Geek Squad Agents and Best Buy employees, we bring an energy and excitement rarely seen in typical summer camps. We've shown youth they can have futures in tech and watched them form lasting friendships.</p><p>As we look ahead, our mission remains the same: to enrich lives and open eyes to the possibilities of tech. We hope to set students on paths to achieve their dreams.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright © 2025 Best Buy.
